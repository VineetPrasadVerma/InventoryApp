# InventoryApp
It is the Seventh and final Project of Google India Nanodegree Scholarship i.e InventoryApp. 
The goal is to design and create the structure of an Inventory App which would allow a store to keep track of its inventory. We will design and implement the backend database that stores information about the products and suppliers. In this app, we'll basically build out the UI for users to add and remove inventory.
